            <h1>A Knitter's Kit</h1>
            <article>
                <p>Everything you need to be the best knitter you can be.
                    Here is a list of essential items to have on hand so you can learn to knit with confidence.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A comfy chair</li>
                    <li>Good lighting</li>
                    <li>Reading glasses or a magnifier</li>
                    <li>Written pattern instructions (If you want to learn how to read a picture pattern click here)
                    </li>
                    <li>Neddles- Double Pointed or Circular (A note about neddles: use one size larger than what the
                        pattern states if you are a tight knitter.)</li>
                    <li>Practice Yarn- (This yarn does not have to be the expensive stuff. Use yarn that is thicker
                        than usual because you will be able to see the stitches better.
                        I recommend not using mohair to practice a swatch or new pattern because it is very fine and
                        hard to tink out.)</li>
                    <li>Scissors</li>
                    <li>Music or your favorite show on in the background</li>
                    <li>Determination that you can do it. (Knitting is fun and relaxing and the best part is a
                        beautiful wearable creation when your finished.)</li>
                </ul>

            <h1>The History of Knitting and Crocheting</h1>
            <article>
                <p>Irish immigrants funded their journey to America because of their skills in knitting and crocheting.
                    Knitting became more and more popular because of Queen Victoria.
                    She learned to knit and spin yarn and shared her creations with family and friends.
                    Woman in the early 1900s considered the intricate patterns of lace work to be the height of fashion.
                    These skills passed down to future generations should be treasured. Take a trip down memory lane and
                    see if your ancestors were knitters or crocheters. Look in the attic, you have some knitted or crocheted
                    family heirlooms.

            <h1>My Favorite Pattern</h1>
            <article>
                <p>Do you have a favorite pattern?
                    There is one pattern that I will always try no matter what yarn I'm using.
                    It's easy, relaxing and you'll have a shawl knitted within a weekend.

                    Here is the simple 2 row repeat.
                    CO5 - Cast On 5 Stitches.
                    R1 - Row #1 k1, kfb, knit to end of row.
                    R2 - Row #2 k1, k2tog, knit to second to last stitch, kfb, k1.
                    That's it, easy peasy!
                    You can use a stitch marker to help you know which side you are on.
                    Abbreviations
                    kfb = knit front back
                    k2tog = knit 2 stitches together
                </p>
