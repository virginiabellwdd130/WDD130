                <p>Earth Tones are in stock!
                    So much yarn. So many beautiful colorways.
                    Take a look at our 2 new colorways that are perfect for your fall projects.
                    Apple Orchard is a warm, happy crisp apple red, mingled with fiery goldenrod, with hints of green
                    and brown leafy tones.
                    Moody Blues is filled with the rich blues and greens of the churning ocean as it meets the sparkling
                    white, starry night sky.

                <h1>Techniques to Know</h1>
                <img src="images/whiteyarnicon2.png" alt="white-yarn">
                <p>Do not let stitches intimidate you. The best
                    way to learn new stitches is by doing a swatch. What is a swatch?
                    A swatch is your friend. Look at any pattern and you will see an option to create a swatch.
                    An example: Using size 5 needles, knit 20 stitches across and 10 rows down. This should measure as a
                    3x3 swatch.
                    This can help you understand not only your tension but also how the colors blend together.

                <h1>Practice Makes Beautiful</h1>
                <img src="images/whiteyarnicon2.png" alt="white-yarn">
                <p>It just takes a little practice to learn how to knit or crochet.
                    Making time to learn is essential.
                    Even if it's only 20 minutes a day, you can do it.
                    Start with something easy, like stockenette stitch or a single crochet pattern.
                    Give knitting a try. If you don't feel comfortable with 2 needles move to 1 needle and learn the
                    basics of crochet.
                    Before you know it you'll be confident creating more advanced stitches like a left or right cable or
                    bobble stitch.
