    <h2>Featured: Yarn of the Week</h2>
    <p>Earth Tones are in stock!
      So much yarn. So many beautiful colorways.
      Take a look at our 2 new colorways that are perfect for your fall projects.
      Apple Orchard is a warm, happy crisp apple red, mingled with fiery goldenrod, with hints of green and brown leafy
      tones.
      Moody Blues is filled with the rich blues and greens of the churning ocean as it meets the sparkling white, starry
      night sky.
    </p>

    <h2>Techniques to Know</h2>
    <p>Do not let stitches intimidate you. The best
      way to learn new stitches is by doing a swatch. What is a swatch?
      A swatch is your friend. Look at any pattern and you will see an option to create a swatch.
      An example: Using size 5 needles, knit 20 stitches across and 10 rows down. This should measure as a 3x3
      swatch.This can help you understand
      not only your tension but also how the colors blend together.
    </p>

    <h2>Practice Makes Beautiful</h2>
    <p>It just takes a little practice to learn how to knit or crochet.
      Making time to learn is essential.
      Even if it's only 20 minutes a day, you can do it.
      Start with something easy, like stockenette stitch or a single crochet pattern.
      Give knitting a try. If you don't feel comfortable with 2 needles move to 1 needle and learn the basics of
      crochet.
      Before you know it you'll be confident creating more advanced stitches like a left or right cable or bobble
      stitch.

      <b>A Knitter's Kit</b> Everything you need to be the best knitter you can be.
      Here is a list of essential items to have on hand so you can learn to knit with confidence.
      -A comfy chair
      -Good lighting
      -Reading glasses or a magnifier
      -Written pattern instructions (If you want to learn how to read a picture pattern click here)
      -Neddles- Double Pointed or Circular (A note about neddles: use one size larger than what the
      pattern states if you are a tight knitter.)
      -Practice Yarn- (This yarn does not have to be the expensive stuff. Use yarn that is thicker
      than usual becuase you will be able to see the stitches better. I recommend not using mohair to
      practice a swatch or new pattern becuase it is very fine and hard to tink out.)
      -Scissors
      -Music or your favorite show on in the background
      -Determination that you can do it. (Knitting is fun and relaxing and the best part is a
      beautiful wearable creation when your finished.)

    <h1>The History of Knitting and Crocheting</h1>
    <article>
      <p>Irish immigrants funded their journey to America because of their skills in knitting and crocheting.
        Knitting became more and more popular because of Queen Victoria.
        She learned to knit and spin yarn and shared her creations with family and friends.
        Woman in the early 1900s considered the intricate patterns of lace work to be the height of fashion.
        These skills passed down to future generations should be treasured. Take a trip down memory lane and see
        if your ancestors were knitters or crocheters. Look in the attic, you have some knitted or crocheted family
        heirlooms. </p>
    </article>

    <h1>My Favorite Pattern</h1>
    <article>
      <p>Do you have a favorite pattern?
        There is one pattern that I will always try no matter what yarn I'm using.
        It's easy, relaxing and you'll have a shawl knitted within a weekend.
        Here is the simple 2 row repeat.
        CO5 - Cast On 5 Stitches. (kfb = knit front back) (k2tog = knit 2 stitches together)
        R1 - Row #1 k1, kfb, knit to end of row.
        R2 - Row #2 k1, k2tog, knit to second to last stitch, kfb, k1.
        That's it, easy peasy!
        You can use a stitch marker to help you know which side you are on.
