        <b>Featured: Yarn of the Week</b>
        So much yarn. So many beautiful colorways. 
        Take a look at our 2 new colorways perfect 
        for your fall projects. Try a warm, happy crisp apple red, mingled
        with fiery goldenrod, with hints of green and brown leafy tones.

        <b>Techniques to Know</b>
        Do not let stitches intimidate you. The best
        way to learn new stitches is by doing a swatch.
        A swatch is your friend. This can help you understand
        not only your tension but also how the colors blend together.
        You can learn how to do a left or right cable or bobble stitch easily with step-by-step tutorials.

        <b>A Knitter's Kit</b> Everything you need to be the best knitter you can be.
        Here is a list of essential items to have on hand so you can learn to knit with confidence.
        -A comfy chair
        -Good lighting
        -Reading glasses or a magnifier
        -Written pattern instructions (If you want to learn how to read a picture pattern click here)
        -Neddles- Double Pointed or Circular (A note about neddles: use one size larger than what the 
        pattern states if you are a tight knitter.)
        -Practice Yarn- (This yarn does not have to be the expensive stuff. Use yarn that is thicker
        than usual becuase you will be able to see the stitches better. I recommend not using mohair to
        practice a swatch or new pattern becuase it is very fine and hard to tink out.)
        -Scissors
        -Music or your favorite show on in the background
        -Determination that you can do it. (Knitting is fun and relaxing and the best part is a
        beautiful wearable creation when your finished.)
