    <h2>Virginia Bell</h2>
    <h2>Ginia Bell</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Virginia Bell, my husband of 26 years calls me Ginia. 
        I've lived in Port Orchard, Washington for 4 years now with my husband 
        and 2 adult daughters. 
        We moved from Saratoga Springs, Utah and I miss it a lot.
        I recently finished the BYU Pathway Program. I'm excited to get 
        more coding lessons and experience as I work toward a Web Development degree.</p> 
        
    <p>I'm not tinkering with a <a>website</a> I've made, I'm knitting. 
        I absoultely love to knit.I knit socks, sweaters, and scarves. 
        It is fun and stress relieving, after a long day working as a 
        customer service specialist at The Home Depot. 
        I hope someday soon I can work from home and build beautiful websites for people.</p>
